                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);

                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {

                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                      the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                      `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a

                      In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all
                      types that they

                      expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                      which use the

                      scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                      set up a type

                      server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                      follows:


                      * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                      * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                      [google.protobuf.Type][]
                        value in binary format, or produce an error.
                      * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                      on the
                        URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                        lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                        on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                        breaking changes.)

                      Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                      official

                      protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                      beginning with

                      type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                      used type server

                      implementations and no plans to implement one.


                      Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                      might be

                      used with implementation specific semantics.

                  `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message
                  along with a

                  URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                  Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in
                  the form

                  of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                  Any type.


                  Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                      Foo foo = ...;
                      Any any;
                      any.PackFrom(foo);
                      ...
                      if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                        ...
                      }

                  Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                      Foo foo = ...;
                      Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                      ...
                      if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                        foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                      }
                      // or ...
                      if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                        foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                      }

                   Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                      foo = Foo(...)
                      any = Any()
                      any.Pack(foo)
                      ...
                      if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                        any.Unpack(foo)
                        ...

                   Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                       foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                       any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                       if err != nil {
                         ...
                       }
                       ...
                       foo := &pb.Foo{}
                       if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                         ...
                       }

                  The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default
                  use

                  'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                  unpack

                  methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last
                  '/'

                  in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                  type

                  name "y.z".


                  JSON

                  ====

                  The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                  representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                  additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                      package google.profile;
                      message Person {
                        string first_name = 1;
                        string last_name = 2;
                      }

                      {
                        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                        "firstName": <string>,
                        "lastName": <string>
                      }

                  If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                  JSON

                  representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
                  field

                  `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                  field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                      {
                        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                        "value": "1.212s"

                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in

                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;

                        }

                        {

                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",

                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the

          * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

          * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]

      Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

      of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


      Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

          Foo foo = ...;
          Any any;
          any.PackFrom(foo);
          ...
          if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
            ...
          }

      Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

          Foo foo = ...;
          Any any = Any.pack(foo);
          ...
          if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
            foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);

          // or ...
          if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
            foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
          }

       Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

          foo = Foo(...)
          any = Any()
          any.Pack(foo)
          ...
          if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
            any.Unpack(foo)
            ...

       Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

           foo := &pb.Foo{...}
           any, err := anypb.New(foo)
           if err != nil {
             ...
           }
           ...
           foo := &pb.Foo{}
           if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
             ...
           }

      The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

      'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

      methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

      in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

      name "y.z".


      JSON

      ====

      The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

      representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

      additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

          package google.profile;
          message Person {
            string first_name = 1;
            string last_name = 2;
          }

          {
            "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
            "firstName": <string>,
            "lastName": <string>
          }

      If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

      representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

      `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

      field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

          {
            "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

            `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along
            with a

            URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


            Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the
            form

            of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any
            type.


            Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                Foo foo = ...;
                Any any;
                any.PackFrom(foo);
                ...
                if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                  ...
                }

            Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                Foo foo = ...;
                Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                ...
                if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                  foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                }
                // or ...
                if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                  foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                }

             Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                foo = Foo(...)
                any = Any()
                any.Pack(foo)
                ...
                if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                  any.Unpack(foo)
                  ...

             Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                 foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                 any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                 if err != nil {
                   ...
                 }
                 ...
                 foo := &pb.Foo{}
                 if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                   ...
                 }

            The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

            'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

            methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

            in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

            name "y.z".


            JSON

            ====

            The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

            representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

            additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                package google.profile;
                message Person {
                  string first_name = 1;
                  string last_name = 2;
                }

                {
                  "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                  "firstName": <string>,
                  "lastName": <string>
                }

            If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

            representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

            `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

            field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                {
                  "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                  "value": "1.212s"
                }

              * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                breaking changes.)

              Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
              official

              protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

              type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely used type
              server

              implementations and no plans to implement one.


              Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

              used with implementation specific semantics.

          `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along
          with a

          URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


          Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the
          form

          of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


          Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any;
              any.PackFrom(foo);
              ...
              if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                ...
              }

          Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any = Any.pack(foo);
              ...
              if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
              }
              // or ...
              if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
              }

           Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

              foo = Foo(...)
              any = Any()
              any.Pack(foo)
              ...
              if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                any.Unpack(foo)
                ...

           Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

               foo := &pb.Foo{...}
               any, err := anypb.New(foo)
               if err != nil {
                 ...
               }
               ...
               foo := &pb.Foo{}
               if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                 ...
               }

          The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

          'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

          methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

          in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

          name "y.z".


          JSON

          ====

          The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

          representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

          additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

              package google.profile;
              message Person {
                string first_name = 1;
                string last_name = 2;
              }

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                "firstName": <string>,
                "lastName": <string>
              }

          If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

          representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

          `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

          field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                "value": "1.212s"
